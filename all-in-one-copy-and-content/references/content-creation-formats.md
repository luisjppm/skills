## Scope

Use for:

- drafting blog posts, social posts, and newsletters
- producing educational and shareable marketing content
- generating headline and hook options for editorial formats

Do not use for:

- webpage conversion architecture (hero, sections, pricing-page flow)
- systematic line-by-line editing sweeps

Handoff:

- for web conversion pages, move to `conversion-copywriting-playbook.md`
- for revision and polish, move to `copy-editing-seven-sweeps.md`
- for final language cleanup, add `plain-english-alternatives.md`
