## Scope

Use for:

- improving existing copy while preserving core message
- running structured editing passes across marketing assets
- identifying weak claims, proof gaps, clarity issues, and friction points

Do not use for:

- deciding long-range content strategy
- building first drafts from scratch when no base copy exists
- choosing page architecture for new conversion pages

Companion references:

- use `natural-transitions.md` for flow polish after sweep passes
- use `plain-english-alternatives.md` for simplification passes

### Sweep 1: Clarity

Focus: immediate comprehension.

Check for:

- confusing structure
- unclear pronouns
- jargon
- ambiguity
- missing context

Process:

1. Mark unclear parts
2. Recommend specific fixes
3. Verify original meaning remains intact

### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone

Focus: consistency of style and personality.

Check for:

- formal/casual whiplash
- inconsistent brand voice
- sudden mood shifts
- mismatched word choice

Process:

1. Read aloud
2. Flag shifts
3. Smooth transitions
4. Recheck clarity

### Sweep 3: So What

Focus: reader value of every claim.

Apply test: ask "so what?" after each key statement.
If the copy cannot answer with a reader benefit, rewrite.

### Sweep 4: Prove It

Focus: evidence strength.

Check for:

- unsupported claims
- missing proof near major promises
- unearned superlatives

Acceptable proof:

- testimonials with attribution
- case-study results
- numbers and sources
- third-party validation
- guarantees and risk reversals

### Sweep 5: Specificity

Focus: concreteness.

Replace vague terms with:

- numbers
- timeframes
- named outcomes
- concrete examples

Examples:

- `Save time` -> `Save 4 hours per week`
- `Many customers` -> `2,847 teams`
- `Fast results` -> `Results in 14 days`

### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion

Focus: emotional resonance.

Improve:

- felt pain
- desired transformation
- tension and relief
- authentic reader motivation

Use emotion to clarify stakes, never to manipulate.

### Sweep 7: Zero Risk

Focus: reducing action barriers.

Check near CTAs for:

- objection handling
- trust cues
- next-step clarity
- risk reversals (trial, guarantee, cancel anytime)

### Sweep Loop Rule

After each later sweep, recheck prior sweeps quickly.
Final pass order: emotion -> specificity -> proof -> so what -> voice -> clarity.

## Quick-Pass Editing Checks

### Word-Level

Cut or reduce:

- very, really, extremely, incredibly
- just, actually, basically
- in order to (use `to`)

| utilize | use |
| implement | set up, do |
| leverage | use |
| facilitate | help |
| innovative | new |
| robust | strong |

Watch for passive voice, adverb clutter, and nominalizations.

### Sentence-Level

- One idea per sentence
- Mix sentence lengths
- Front-load key information
- Keep conjunctions limited
- Keep most lines under 25 words

### Paragraph-Level

- One topic per paragraph
- 2-4 sentence paragraphs for web
- Strong opening lines
- Clear flow and white space
