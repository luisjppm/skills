## Scope

Use for:

- deciding what to publish, why, and in what order
- mapping topics to buyer stage and intent type
- clustering content for internal-linking and authority

Do not use for:

- drafting full articles, posts, or page copy
- line-by-line copy edits

Handoff:

- pass prioritized topics to `content-creation-formats.md` for production drafts
- pass page-level conversion work to `conversion-copywriting-playbook.md`

### Searchable vs Shareable Framework

Treat every content idea as `searchable`, `shareable`, or `both`.
Prioritize searchable content first to capture existing demand.

#### Searchable Content

- Target a specific keyword or question
- Match search intent exactly
- Use clear query-aligned titles
- Mirror search patterns in headings
- Place key terms in title, H1/H2s, intro, and URL slug
- Cover the topic comprehensively
- Include proof, examples, and credible sources
- Optimize for AI discovery with clear structure and consistent brand language

#### Shareable Content

- Lead with novel insight or contrarian angle
- Use stories that trigger emotion and recognition
- Challenge common beliefs with evidence
- Tie to current trends or emerging pain points
- Create ideas people share to help others or signal expertise

### Content Types

#### Searchable Types

1. Use-case content (`persona + use-case`)
2. Hub and spoke clusters
3. Template libraries with high-intent keywords

#### Shareable Types

1. Thought leadership
2. Data-driven content and original research
3. Expert roundups
4. Case studies
5. Meta content (behind-the-scenes transparency)

### Pillars and Topic Clusters

Define 3-5 pillars your brand can own.
Each pillar should be:

- product-aligned
- audience-relevant
- supported by search/social demand
- broad enough for multiple subtopics

Use this structure:

```text
Pillar Topic
|- Cluster 1
|  |- Article A
|  |- Article B
|- Cluster 2
|  |- Article C
|  |- Article D
|- Cluster 3
   |- Article E
   |- Article F
```

### Keyword Mapping by Buyer Stage

- Awareness: `what is`, `how to`, `guide to`, `introduction to`
- Consideration: `best`, `top`, `vs`, `alternatives`, `comparison`
- Decision: `pricing`, `reviews`, `demo`, `trial`, `buy`
- Implementation: `template`, `examples`, `tutorial`, `setup`, `how to use`

### Ideation Inputs

Use one or more:

1. Keyword exports (Ahrefs, SEMrush, GSC)
2. Sales/customer call transcripts
3. Surveys
4. Forum mining (Reddit, Quora, niche communities)
5. Competitor content audits
6. Sales/support objection logs

Extract:

- repeated questions
- recurring objections
- language patterns
- demand gaps
- competitor blind spots

### Prioritization Model

Score each idea with weighted criteria:

- Customer impact: 40%
- Content-market fit: 30%
- Search potential: 20%
- Resource requirement: 10%

Template:

| Idea | Customer Impact | Content-Market Fit | Search Potential | Resources | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Topic A | 8 | 9 | 7 | 6 | 8.0 |
| Topic B | 6 | 7 | 9 | 8 | 7.1 |

### Strategy Output Format

When delivering strategy, include:

1. `Content pillars` with rationale
2. `Priority topics` with content type, keyword, buyer stage, intent type
3. `Cluster map` showing internal linking logic
4. `Production order` (now, next, later)
5. `Success metrics` (traffic, CTR, conversion, assisted revenue)
