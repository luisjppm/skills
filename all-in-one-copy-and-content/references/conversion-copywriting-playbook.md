## Scope

Use for:

- high-intent website pages designed to convert
- homepage, landing, pricing, feature, product, and about page messaging
- section architecture that moves readers from problem to action

Do not use for:

- editorial calendars or topic-cluster planning
- social/newsletter-first content formats
- deep line-by-line editing passes

Handoff:

- for editing and sweep diagnostics, move to `copy-editing-seven-sweeps.md`
- for final simplification and fluency, add `plain-english-alternatives.md` and `natural-transitions.md`

### Section Writing Tips

#### Problem Section

Use openers like:

- You know the feeling...
- If you are like most [role]...
- Every day, [audience] struggles with...

Then define:

- the exact friction
- cost of inaction
- impact on outcomes

#### Benefits Section

For each benefit include:

- outcome headline
- 1-2 sentence explanation
- optional proof point

#### How It Works Section

Keep each step:

- numbered
- action-oriented
- outcome-focused

Example:

1. Connect your tools
2. Set your preferences
3. Receive automated results

### CTA Guidelines

Avoid weak CTAs:

- Submit
- Learn More
- Click Here
- Get Started

Use specific CTAs:

- Start Free Trial
- Get the Checklist
- See Product in Action
- Create My First [Thing]
- See Pricing for My Team

CTA formula: `[Action Verb] + [What they get] + [Qualifier if needed]`

### Page-Specific Notes

- Homepage: serve multiple intents without becoming generic
- Landing page: one message, one CTA, match traffic-source intent
- Pricing page: reduce decision anxiety and guide plan choice
- Feature page: map feature -> benefit -> outcome
- About page: story + mission + CTA

### Copywriting Output Format

Deliver:

1. Full section-by-section copy
2. 2-3 headline alternatives with rationale
3. 2-3 CTA alternatives with rationale
4. Optional SEO metadata (title + meta description)
