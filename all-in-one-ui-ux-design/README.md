# all-in-one-ui-ux-design

Comprehensive UI/UX skill for modern interfaces: creative direction, design
system definition, implementation guidance, accessibility/performance
guardrails, and strict review workflows that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## What this skill does

- Defines a clear visual direction before coding.
- Builds coherent design systems (tokens, typography, spacing, motion, states).
- Guides implementation across web and mobile stacks.
- Runs strict UI audits for accessibility, interaction quality, and performance.
- Prevents cookie-cutter output with anti-generic guardrails and creativity rules.

## When to use it

Use this skill when you need help with:

- designing new pages, apps, or components
- redesigning existing UI without regressing UX quality
- creating a reusable design system for a project
- auditing frontend code for UI/UX issues
- improving visual quality while keeping production readiness

## Why it is useful

- One workflow covers strategy, implementation, and audit in sequence.
- Keeps strong creative direction without sacrificing accessibility and usability.
- Includes reusable primitives for speed without forcing fixed templates.

## Quick prompt examples

- "Design and build a high-conversion landing page for a fintech startup."
- "Redesign this dashboard UI but keep all current functionality."
- "Create a design system for this product and implement core components."
- "Audit these React files for UI/UX, accessibility, and interaction issues."
- "Improve this interface so it feels custom, not generic AI-generated."

## Important implementation note

Treat `assets/` as scaffolding, not final identity. Retheme tokens, recombine
layouts, and customize interactions before delivery to avoid template-looking
results.
